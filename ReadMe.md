# Tools
### Desciption
Through my years of learning computer science, I’ve tried to learn cybersecurity alongside it. I started from the basics and worked my way up through different layers of the OSI model and beyond (hardware, Android, etc.). Along this journey, I created these tools to test different things out. Enjoy!

I hope you don’t get annoyed by my bad coding skills.
